NOTE: DEVELOPMENT PAUSED UNTIL MORE DEVELOPERS CAN BE FOUND

NOTE: THE GAME IS STILL IN VERY EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, THE CONTENTS OF THIS FILE ARE THE FINAL GOALS THAT THE GAME WILL HAVE ATTAINED FOR RELEASE

This repository contains all the code, art and sounds for the game Rising Legend (subject to change). The game is of the RPG genre, where you will play as a character and help develop yourself to pursue your own final objective. 

At the start, you get pitted in a random settlement in your world. You will have to fend for yourself, and compete to be the best at your job, as you aspire to be a man/woman of importance in your realm. You may engage in politics, negotiationg agreements with other settlements and factions as well as managing your own city, collecting taxes, spending those taxes on public buildings, and perhaps to further your own agenda. You may also engage in trade, buying goods from nearby or remote settlements, crafting more refined objects, selling them to your people or those beyond the walls of your home town. Employ people to work for you, buy lots to build on, incentivise the nobles (politicians) to improve your profits, and do all that is possible to improve your standing. If you are seeking a more adventurous life, you may become a soldier or a mercenary. Go on quests issued by the townspeople, investigate your surroundings, fight for your people and pride, or simply to make a profit. There is no end to the possibilities, so choose your path and good luck finding gold and glory!
